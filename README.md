# Programming Task via Matlab creating a modified Map
As part of the university lecture "Angewandtes Programmieren" from the
studies of audiology in the Jade-Hochschule Oldenburg, it was the task to
create a program basing upon the given "Map.m" and a table of measured 
network reception data "celldata.mat" to draw a heatmap of Oldenburg where
also the positions of the radio masts are given.
It was free to include whatever fits, so some features were added.
Besides the distance to the nearest radio mast, the table consists of 
information to which network provider the mast belongs and what sort of 
network is being used (UMTS, LTE or GSM). 
With this program the user is free to choose which radio masts of which 
networking system and provider he wants to see. In addition to that it is
not only possible to get a map of Oldenburg, but also of every other town
in Germany with this display options.
##Getting Started
To get this program, all you have to do is, download the zip-file of the
[GitHub-homepage](https://github.com/Skarborn/ProgrammierProject1.git)
and run it on Matlab including the path from where it has to run.
When you do not own Matlab in any version, you can download it at the 
owner's expense on the [MathWorks-homepage]
(https://www.mathworks.de/downloads).
